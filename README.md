# Big numbers
Solving 1st task for Big Data course

## How to run?
Make sure you have poetry installed :)
then run `poetry install` inside the repo directory.

After that, you may run sctipts directly by names:

`generate_big_number -s desired_size -o output_file_name --batching`

`get_statistic -i input_file_name --allow_multithreading`

You may omit flags `batching` and `allow_multithreading` to remove their effects.
